What is Flexbox and its role in React Native layout?

Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a layout system used in React Native to design responsive and adaptive user interfaces.
It helps in aligning, distributing, and sizing components within a container — even when their size is dynamic or unknown.

React Native uses Flexbox as its primary layout system, just like CSS, but with a few property name differences and some defaults optimized for mobile.

Key Properties of Flexbox:
Property	Description
flexDirection	Defines the main axis — row (horizontal) or column (vertical, default).
justifyContent	Aligns children along the main axis (flex-start, center, space-between, etc.).
alignItems	Aligns children along the cross axis (flex-start, center, stretch, etc.).
flex	Defines how much space an item should take relative to others.
alignSelf	Overrides alignItems for individual items.
flexWrap	Allows items to wrap to the next line if space is insufficient.
Example:
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const FlexExample = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <View style={styles.box1}><Text>Box 1</Text></View>
      <View style={styles.box2}><Text>Box 2</Text></View>
      <View style={styles.box3}><Text>Box 3</Text></View>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    flexDirection: 'row', // Layout items horizontally
    justifyContent: 'space-around', // Distribute space evenly
    alignItems: 'center', // Align items vertically in center
  },
  box1: { backgroundColor: 'skyblue', padding: 20 },
  box2: { backgroundColor: 'orange', padding: 20 },
  box3: { backgroundColor: 'lightgreen', padding: 20 },
});

export default FlexExample;

Why Flexbox is important in React Native:

📱 Responsive layouts: Adjusts automatically to various screen sizes and orientations.

🧩 Simplified design: Reduces the need for manual positioning or fixed dimensions.

⚡ Cross-platform consistency: Works the same on Android, iOS, and web.






14. What are 'keys' in React Native and why are they important in lists?

Keys are unique identifiers assigned to elements in a list.
They help React Native track which items have changed, been added, or removed, allowing it to efficiently re-render only the necessary components.
Without keys, React may re-render the entire list unnecessarily, leading to performance issues or incorrect UI updates.

✅ Example:

{data.map(item => <Text key={item.id}>{item.name}</Text>)}

15. How can you make a network request in React Native?

You can make network requests using:

The fetch API (built-in)

Or third-party libraries like Axios

These allow you to fetch data from APIs asynchronously using Promises or async/await syntax.

✅ Example:

const fetchData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
};

16. Describe the purpose of 'AsyncStorage' in React Native.

AsyncStorage provides persistent, asynchronous, key-value storage on the device.
It’s typically used for storing user preferences, auth tokens, or small bits of app data locally.

⚠️ Note: AsyncStorage has been moved to the community package:

npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage


✅ Example:

await AsyncStorage.setItem('userToken', token);
const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem('userToken');

17. How can you integrate Redux with a React Native app?

Redux is integrated by:

Creating a store to hold global state.

Wrapping your app in a <Provider> from react-redux.

Defining reducers and actions to manage state changes.

Connecting components using useSelector and useDispatch.

✅ Example:

import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { store } from './store';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <RootNavigator />
    </Provider>
  );
}

18. How do you optimize performance in a React Native application?

Performance optimization involves:

Using React.memo / PureComponent to prevent unnecessary re-renders

Using FlatList instead of ScrollView for large lists

Optimizing images with caching

Avoiding anonymous functions and inline styles inside render

Profiling with Flipper or React DevTools

Reducing JS thread work and using native modules for heavy tasks

19. Explain the concept of 'HOC' (Higher-Order Component) in React Native.

A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns an enhanced component with additional functionality.
It’s used to reuse logic such as authentication checks, data fetching, or logging.

✅ Example:

function withLogger(WrappedComponent) {
  return (props) => {
    console.log('Rendered:', WrappedComponent.name);
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
  };
}

20. How can you integrate third-party libraries in a React Native app?

You can integrate libraries using npm or yarn:

npm install library-name


Then import and use them in your components.
For libraries with native code, link them automatically with:

npx pod-install


(For older RN versions, react-native link was used.)

21. What are 'Touchable' components in React Native and how do they work?

Touchable components provide press and gesture interaction for UI elements.
Common types include:

TouchableOpacity

TouchableHighlight

TouchableWithoutFeedback

Pressable (modern and more flexible)

They detect user touches (onPress, onLongPress) and provide visual feedback like opacity changes.

✅ Example:

<TouchableOpacity onPress={() => alert('Pressed!')}>
  <Text>Click Me</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>

22. How do you handle form validation in React Native?

You can validate forms by managing input values in state, checking them on submission, and showing error messages.
You can also use libraries like Formik, Yup, or react-hook-form for robust validation.

✅ Example (basic):

if (!email.includes('@')) {
  setError('Enter a valid email address');
}

23. Explain the architecture of a React Native app.

A React Native app follows a component-based architecture, consisting of:

UI Components – reusable building blocks

State & Props – data flow management

Business Logic – using Context API or Redux

Navigation – handled by React Navigation

Bridge – connects JavaScript with native Android/iOS modules

🧩 JS Code → Bridge → Native Platform → UI

24. What is the role of 'navigator' in React Navigation?

A navigator is a component that defines the navigation structure of your app.
It manages screen transitions, the navigation stack, and history.

Types of navigators:

StackNavigator

TabNavigator

DrawerNavigator

✅ Example:

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator();
<Stack.Navigator>
  <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
</Stack.Navigator>

25. How do you handle platform-specific code in React Native?

You can handle platform-specific behavior in two ways:

Using the Platform API:

import { Platform } from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  text: {
    color: Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 'blue' : 'green',
  },
});


Platform-specific files:

Component.ios.js

Component.android.js
